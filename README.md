Angular based SoundCloud streaming and Mixing App

Live demo: http://sw4.github.io/soundcloudj/

IMPORTANT: Code has not been cleaned. Locally hosted images will not load in the demo. As such the demo does not represent full fidelity.

The app allows the compostion and management of custom setlists sourced by browsing SoundCloud tracks / playlists. Tracks are auto-cued and mixed together depending on crossfades defined by the user. This allows for far more seamless audio feedback and greater user control than offered by SoundCloud directly.
